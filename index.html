        <h3>Heavy Equipment Operator</h3>
        <p>
            As a Heavy Equipment Operator I was able to learn how to multi-task and provide customer service.<br>
            Tasks, under this job title, inlcuded: prepping sites for foundations, digging ditches for drain tile, digging craters for lakes, and maintaining heavy equipment.<br>
            I used backhoes, skid steers, trackhoes, trenchers, front-end buckets, shovels, GPS equipment, trucks, and other various tools to perform job related tasks.<br>
            This job was physically exhausting at times but very rewarding when clients would send you referrals for new jobs.

        <h3>Lab Technician</h3>
        <p>
            Being a Lab Technician helped me learn communication skills and furthered along my customer service skills.<br>
            Under this job title I would sometimes draw patient's blood or retrieve other kinds of specimens. Since this required making relationships with people, I learned how to deal with people who were experiencing a lot of stress.<br>
            I would also send in specimens to the main lab for testing to be performed. Once the test/s were finalized we would let the patient's doctor know of the outcome.<br>
            This job position was rewarding because I was able to help people just by being there for them and having a listening ear.

        <h3>Piano Technician</h3>
        <p>
            With this being my current job I can talk a lot about it. It is a very unique job position to have.<br>
            Sometimes I call myself a piano surgeon. Most of the work I perform includes restoring and repairing older pianos.<br>
            I usually have jobs scheduled in advance up to a few weeks. Therefore, I am able to look ahead of what jobs I will be taking on so I know what to expect.<br>
            I tune pianos, move/deliver pianos, repair various parts and pieces to pianos, rebuild old or worn out pianos, and deal with any client issues.<br>
            This job has been my longest held job and since I have played piano since I was 10 this job came natural to me. I has helped me develop a lot of positive workings skills that can help me for the job I aspire to have in the near future.

        <h3>Aspiring Future Career</h3>
        <p>
            My past and current work experience have led me on a pursuit to become engaged in codiing.<br>
            I have always had an interest in coding. I have taken some free online course through various well-know websites like CodeCademy, TeamTreehouse, FreeCodeCampe and many more.<br>
            My passion for coding enlightened when I had found out about LaunchCode and it's courses that it offered. This gave me a drive to pursure a career that I would eventually like to have.<br>
            I see myself working as a Front End Developer in the near future, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
            Ideally, I would like to become a software developer or some other title while working with JavaScript.<br>
            I would not know exactly where this path with take me but I love to learn knew things, implement things I learn, and apply them to provide clients with great projects.
